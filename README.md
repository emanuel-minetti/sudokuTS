# SudokuTS
SudokuTS is a TypeScript implementation of the well-known
Sudoku game. It is planned to develop a fully functional
solver and generator of sudoku puzzles. The generator
will be able to categorize puzzles in difficulty rates.
It is also planned to add a Browser-based GUI.

## Building
In order to build the SudokuTS, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
